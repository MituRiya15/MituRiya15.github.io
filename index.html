				<h3><b>Why I've choosed CSE to study?</b></h3>

			<font size="6px" color="black">
				<h3>The sector of Computer Science and Engineering is the most challenging and demanding sector in today's world. It's basically a series of programming challenges and I have to find the solution. Although I wanted to be an engineer since my childhood, I never thought about which sector I would go to. When I was in class 10, I first became interested in computer science by seeing a older sister doing C programming who is now a computer engineer. I've been slowly trying to learn about this. I got a better idea by studying ICT at HSC level. Then when I miss A+ in HSC and then when I don't get a chance in any engineering subject in different public universities, I got very frustrated.  Then my relatives and my parents asked me to prepare anew that I should be admitted in the subject of my choice in private university and also inspired me that I'll do better in the future. Then I took admission in UIU, and thus I started my initial journey to take Computer Science and Engineering as my career. I've confidence that I can, Allah knows the rest. This is my story behind studying CSE.</h3>
